# README

This app is a movie review Rails app.  Part of my 14 in 14.  Users are able to log in, log out, and submit movies and reviews.  The gems that were used in creating the app were:

Paperclip (for attaching images to the db)

Devise (for user authentication)

Jquery/Raty (for 5 star rating system)

All functionality works thus far.  This app will be upgraded at the end of the challenge, for functionality and styling.  

Possible upgrades to functionality include, but are not limited to:

-Search function (from scratch) for movie titles, directors, and possibly actors.

-Overall restyling

-a scraper that pulls live Movies, as opposed to user created movies

Thanks for stopping by!
